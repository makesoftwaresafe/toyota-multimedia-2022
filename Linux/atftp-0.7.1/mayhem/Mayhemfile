# Mayhem by https://forallsecure.com
# Mayhemfile: configuration file for testing your target with Mayhem
# Format: YAML 1.1

# Mayhemfile version specifier
version: '1.16'

# Namespaced project name that the target belongs to
project: makesoftwaresafe/toyota-multimedia-2022

# Target name (should be unique within the project)
target: atftp-atftpd-tftp

# Base image to run the binary in.
baseimage: $MAYHEM_DOCKER_REGISTRY/makesoftwaresafe/toyota-multimedia-2022/atftpd:latest

# List of commands used to test the target
cmds:

  # Command used to start the target, "@@" is the input file
  # (when "@@" is omitted Mayhem defaults to stdin inputs)
  - cmd: /usr/local/bin/atftpd --daemon --no-fork --user root.root --logfile - /tftpboot

    ## Uncomment to change default dir (/) from which the target is invoked
    #chdir: /

    ## If this is a network target, uncomment the block below and remove
    ## the @@ input file reference in the cmd (you can either test network or
    ## file inputs, not both).
    network:
    # Use "127.0.0.1" instead of "localhost" below if you want to test only
    # for IPv4. For IPv6, use "[::1]". By leaving as "localhost", Mayhem will
    # attempt to autodetect the one used by the target.
      url: udp://localhost:69    # protocol, host and port to analyze
      is_client: false           # target is a client-side program
      timeout: 2.0               # max seconds for sending data

    ## Max test case length (in bytes) to be taken into account. Test cases over
    ## that length will be truncated. Be very careful about increasing this
    ## limit as it can severely affect your fuzzer performance.
    # max_length: 8192
