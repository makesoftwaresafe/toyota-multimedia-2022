Service		org.ofono
Interface	org.ofono.NetworkMonitor
Object path	[variable prefix]/{modem0,modem1,...}

Methods		a{sv} GetServingCellInformation()

			Requests the latest serving cell information and basic
			measurements from oFono.  The returned value is a
			dictionary with the possible key / values documented
			below.  The type of cell is given by the 'Technology'
			property.

			Based on the type of cell, the dictionary will contain
			additional key/value pairs.  If a given key/value pair
			is not present, then it is not known or unsupported
			by the underlying driver.

			Refer to the sections below for which property types
			are available, their valid value ranges and
			applicability to different cell types.
